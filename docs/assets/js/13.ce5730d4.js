However, being excellent all-in-one and easy to set up devices,\nnetwork audio players still have limitations:\nthey have a built-in DAC, which you cannot swap;\nthey might not support some storage devices, such as HDD;\nthey might not support some audio formats, take DSD128 for example;\nthey are usually controlled with a mobile app, which might be inconvenient or\nbuggy;\nthey are rather expensive!\nAn alternative to a ready-made network audio player would be a PC with proper\nsoftware and a USB DAC.\nWhen it comes to the software, my personal recommendation would be to go with\nMusic Player Daemon (MPD). It is an extremely flexible, powerful, server-side\napplication for playing music. MPD features:\nsupport of ALSA output and hence bit-perfect playback;\na great variety of audio formats supported (plays anything, really);\na wide selection of clients available, from console to mobile apps, for remote\nplayback control.\nAnd it is free! As is Linux.\nMy Personal Setup\nI wanted to start with a Raspberry Pi or something similar, but in the end I\nbought an Intel NUC mini PC unit, and installed RAM and SSD in it â€” payed less\nthan $250 for everything.\nThe NUC is running Debain Linux. I installed a VPN server and an NFS server to\nmake my media library available throughout the network, and a miniDLNA server\nfor video streaming. Finally, I installed MPD and configured it to output audio\nvia ALSA to the Arcam irDAC-II connected via USB.")])])},[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
